# Visual Drag and Drop Indicator Enhancement

## Summary
Enhanced the visual feedback system for drag and drop operations to provide clearer indicators when dragging cards over potential drop targets.

## Changes Made

### Before
- Only the background color of the entire card control changed to show valid (light green) or invalid (light coral) drop zones
- Visual feedback was limited to the top and bottom of cards

### After  
- Added colored border indicators on all four sides of cards (left, right, top, bottom)
- Maintains the existing background color change behavior
- Provides more prominent visual cues around the entire card perimeter

## Technical Implementation

### XAML Changes (CardUserControl.xaml)
Added four Rectangle elements to create side indicators:
- `LeftIndicator`: 4px wide rectangle on the left edge
- `RightIndicator`: 4px wide rectangle on the right edge  
- `TopIndicator`: 4px high rectangle on the top edge
- `BottomIndicator`: 4px high rectangle on the bottom edge

All indicators start collapsed and transparent.

### C# Changes (CardUserControl.xaml.cs)

#### DragEnter Event
- Shows all four side indicators with appropriate color (green for valid moves, red for invalid)
- Sets indicator visibility to `Visible`
- Maintains existing opacity change (0.8)

#### DragLeave Event  
- Hides all side indicators by setting visibility to `Collapsed`
- Restores full opacity (1.0)

#### Drop Event
- Hides all side indicators after drop completion
- Restores full opacity (1.0)
- Maintains existing drop handling logic

## Visual Behavior

### Valid Drop Zone
- Green borders appear on all four sides of the target card
- Card becomes slightly transparent (80% opacity)
- Clear visual indication that the drop is allowed

### Invalid Drop Zone
- Red borders appear on all four sides of the target card  
- Card becomes slightly transparent (80% opacity)
- Clear visual indication that the drop is not allowed

### No Drag Operation
- All indicators remain hidden
- Card displays normally with full opacity

## Testing
Added comprehensive tests in `VisualIndicatorLogicTests.cs` to validate the core logic that drives indicator colors:
- Tests for valid moves (should show green indicators)
- Tests for invalid moves (should show red indicators)  
- Tests for edge cases like Kings on empty spaces

All existing tests continue to pass, ensuring no regressions were introduced.
