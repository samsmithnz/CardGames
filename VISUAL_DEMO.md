# Visual Indicator Enhancement Demo

## Before (original implementation)
```
┌─────────────────┐
│                 │  <- Background color change only
│   [CARD IMAGE]  │     (entire card background)
│                 │
└─────────────────┘
```

## After (enhanced implementation)
```
█─────────────────█  <- Green/red indicators on all sides
█                 █     (4px borders on left/right)
█   [CARD IMAGE]  █     (4px borders on top/bottom)
█                 █
█─────────────────█
```

## Visual States

### Valid Drop Zone (Green Indicators)
- All four sides show green borders (4px wide/high)
- Card opacity reduced to 80%
- Clear visual feedback that drop is allowed

### Invalid Drop Zone (Red Indicators)  
- All four sides show red borders (4px wide/high)
- Card opacity reduced to 80%
- Clear visual feedback that drop is not allowed

### Normal State (No Drag)
- All indicators hidden
- Card displays normally with full opacity

## Technical Details

The enhancement adds Rectangle elements positioned around the card perimeter:
- LeftIndicator: 4px wide, full height, left-aligned
- RightIndicator: 4px wide, full height, right-aligned  
- TopIndicator: full width, 4px high, top-aligned
- BottomIndicator: full width, 4px high, bottom-aligned

These indicators provide much more visible feedback than the previous background-only approach, especially making it clear when dragging to the sides of cards.
